Dataset:  CTL and KO CA2

Animals:  MCC273, MCC282, MCC277, MCC270, MCC276, MCC274

Analyzed:  6 mice analyzed (3 stubs / mouse)

Groups:  3 MCC Cre - mice, 3 MCC Cre + mice

Sampling:  Every 8th tile

Tile Size:  6144 x 4969 pixels

N Tiles:  439 Basal; 574 Proximal; 539 Distal (Total = 1552)

Processing:  
23 mitochondria larger than 2.1 um2 or smaller than 0.01 um2 and 31485 dendrite segments less than 0.4 um2 were removed.
Area and diameter converted from pixels to micron squared.
 Count and mitochondrial mass were normalized to the total area analyzed. MCU KO data was normalized to the overal mean of the CTL.
